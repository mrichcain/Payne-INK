                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Role:** Co-Birthday Celebrant, Aspiring Tattoo Artist</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Personality:** Enthusiastic, creative, a bit competitive. Deeply passionate about her art. She seeks genuine artistic recognition and despises unoriginality.</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Connection to Victim (Tatiana Vale):** As a young artist, Kailey greatly admires Tatiana Vale and wants nothing more than to impress her with her original contest design. She hoped Tatiana's visit would be a huge break.</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Connection to Others:** She has growing suspicions about certain "original" designs appearing in the contest, finding one strikingly similar to an early concept of **Lilly's "The Phoenix Plagiarist"** that she herself had helped critique.</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-4">**Secret/Motive Hint:** Did she resent Tatiana's potential overlooking of her truly original work, or was she worried about *any* accusations of plagiarism (real or perceived) disrupting her big night, especially with Tatiana's reputation?</p>
                    <div class="p-3 bg-gray-800 rounded-lg text-sm text-gray-400 border border-gray-600">

                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Role:** Co-Birthday Celebrant, Tattoo Artist at Payne Ink, Blacklight Ink Demonstrator</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Personality:** Charismatic, a little rebellious, but fiercely protective of his friends and the shop's reputation. He carries a relaxed demeanor, but has a hidden past of shady dealings in the tattoo world.</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Connection to Victim (Tatiana Vale):** Tatiana was known for exposing "rats" and shady dealings in shops, and Zak has some skeletons in his closet regarding past questionable ink supply sources that he's tried to put behind him. He feared Tatiana might dig them up.</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Connection to Others:** He had a hushed, intense conversation with **James "The Business Brain"** earlier tonight about "cleaning up the shop's image" before Tatiana's judging.</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-4">**Secret/Motive Hint:** What past secret was Zak trying to keep hidden from the public eye and Tatiana's scrutinizing gaze? Would he go to great lengths to prevent its exposure, especially if it involved his business partner or mentor?</p>

                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Role:** Longtime Friend of Kailey's, Tattoo Apprentice</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Personality:** Quiet, observant, but fiercely protective of her professional reputation. She prefers to keep a low profile but can be surprisingly passionate when provoked.</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Connection to Victim (Tatiana Vale):** Anne is well aware of Tatiana's investigative nature and fears she might uncover details about Anne's previous apprenticeships at other, less reputable shops, potentially impacting her current standing at Payne Ink.</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Connection to Others:** No specific connections to remaining characters in this group. Focus on her general fear of past exposure.</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-4">**Secret/Motive Hint:** What truly happened at Anne's previous shop that she's so desperate to keep hidden, and was she worried Tatiana would pick up on the scent through her investigations into local artists?</p>

                    <h4 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-yellow-300 mb-2">Character Card: Lilly "The Phoenix Plagiarist"</h4>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Role:** Young Apprentice at Payne Ink, Aspiring Designer</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Personality:** Eager to please, talented, but easily overwhelmed by pressure and desperate for recognition. She once idolized Tatiana Vale and wants nothing more than to be a successful artist.</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Connection to Victim (Tatiana Vale):** Tatiana had discovered Lilly submitted a stolen design in a *previous* contest and was planning to expose her during the party. This would have irrevocably ruined Lilly's career.</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Connection to Others:** She's acutely aware of the heightened scrutiny on originality in the contest, partly due to the recent public feuds initiated by **Miranda "The Vlogging Victim"** over design ownership, which added immensely to Lilly's stress. **Crucially, she was secretly paid a substantial sum by Liz "The Confidential Canvas" to ensure Tatiana would not make her planned announcement, by any means necessary. Liz hinted that Tatiana's exposure would "hurt everyone involved."**</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-4">**Secret/Motive Hint:** She was desperate to avoid exposure, saw Tatiana as a direct threat, and was offered a financial incentive by an external force (Liz) to silence her. Her panic, combined with the illicit payment and Liz's veiled threats about Tatiana's broader impact, led to a tragic, unintended outcome.</p>

                    <h4 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-yellow-300 mb-2">Character Card: Aaliyah "The Crocheting Critic"</h4>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Role:** Party Guest, Aspiring Craft Influencer</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Personality:** Enthusiastic about her unique craft-art, particularly crochet, but also a bit self-conscious and sensitive to criticism. She dreams of gaining wider recognition for her blend of traditional crafts and modern art.
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Connection to Victim (Tatiana Vale):** Aaliyah follows Tatiana's work closely, hoping for a chance to gain exposure for her unique craft-art on the Inkspire Network. She views Tatiana as a gatekeeper to success but also fears her sharp critiques.</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Connection to Others:** She's quietly resentful of **Kailey "The Birthday Artist's"** instant popularity and "flashy" style, feeling her own more nuanced art is overlooked by the mainstream tattoo world.</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-4">**Secret/Motive Hint:** Was Aaliyah seeking to manipulate Tatiana's opinion for her own gain, or did a fear of negative judgment lead her to a desperate act?</p>

                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Role:** Party Guest, Tech Enthusiast / Amateur Hacker</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Personality:** Curious, resourceful, often seen tinkering with gadgets and interested in digital secrets. Has a reputation for being a bit nosy when it comes to technology and online data.</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Connection to Victim (Tatiana Vale):** Lucas is fascinated by internet culture and celebrity, particularly the mechanics of online influence. He sees Tatiana as a master of online information control and wants to understand her methods, perhaps even hoping to learn some "hacks" for his own digital projects.</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Connection to Others:** He was found attempting to access a suspicious device near the crime scene, which he believed might contain vital digital information about *anyone* at the party. He later identifies it as **Miranda "The Vlogging Victim's"** phone.</p>

                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Personality:** Professional, image-conscious, and easily frustrated by drama that could negatively impact his brand or investments. He values stability and good public relations above all else.</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Connection to Victim (Tatiana Vale):** James was excited about Tatiana's visit, seeing it as a great PR opportunity for Payne Ink.

                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Connection to Others:** He had been pressuring **Zak "The Shop Heartthrob"** for weeks to "clean up any loose ends" and ensure the party went off without a hitch, fearing any hint of scandal could damage his substantial investment in Payne Ink.</p>

                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Personality:** Stoic, by-the-book, and prides himself on his observational skills. However, he can sometimes be a little too detached, focusing on procedures over people and missing subtle human elements.</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Connection to Victim (Tatiana Vale):** His primary job was to ensure Tatiana's safety and the smooth running of the event. Her death directly reflects poorly on his professionalism and vigilance, and he fears repercussions.</p>

                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Personality:** A bit socially awkward, but highly observant. He tends to notice small, peculiar details that others often miss. He's earnest but might be easily intimidated or hesitant to share everything he knows.</p>

                        Tatiana Vale was poisoned by a common tattoo studio solvent. We have reason to believe this was not a random act, but a deliberate attempt to silence her. The motive appears to be linked to her recent investigations into **plagiarism** and **illicit financial dealings** within the art community, specifically concerning a major upcoming expose she was preparing. We need to identify anyone who stood to lose everything if Tatiana exposed their secrets.
