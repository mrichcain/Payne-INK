                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Role:** Co-Birthday Celebrant, Aspiring Tattoo Artist</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Personality:** Enthusiastic, creative, a bit competitive. Deeply passionate about her art. She seeks genuine artistic recognition and despises unoriginality.</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Connection to Victim (Tatiana Vale):** As a young artist, Kailey greatly admires Tatiana Vale and wants nothing more than to impress her with her original contest design. She hoped Tatiana's visit would be a huge break.</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Connection to Others:** She has growing suspicions about certain "original" designs appearing in the contest, finding one strikingly similar to an early concept of **Lilly's "The Phoenix Plagiarist"** that she herself had helped critique.</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300">**Secret/Motive Hint:** Did she resent Tatiana's potential overlooking of her truly original work, or was she worried about *any* accusations of plagiarism (real or perceived) disrupting her big night, especially with Tatiana's reputation?</p>
                </div>

                    <h4 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-yellow-300 mb-2">Character Card: Zak "The Shop Heartthrob"</h4>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Role:** Co-Birthday Celebrant, Tattoo Artist at Payne Ink, Blacklight Ink Demonstrator</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Personality:** Charismatic, a little rebellious, but fiercely protective of his friends and the shop's reputation. He carries a relaxed demeanor, but has a hidden past of shady dealings in the tattoo world.</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Connection to Victim (Tatiana Vale):** Tatiana was known for exposing "rats" and shady dealings in shops, and Zak has some skeletons in his closet regarding past questionable ink supply sources that he's tried to put behind him. He feared Tatiana might dig them up.</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Connection to Others:** He had a hushed, intense conversation with **James "The Business Brain"** earlier tonight about "cleaning up the shop's image" before Tatiana's judging.</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300">**Secret/Motive Hint:** What past secret was Zak trying to keep hidden from the public eye and Tatiana's scrutinizing gaze? Would he go to great lengths to prevent its exposure, especially if it involved his business partner or mentor?</p>

                    <h4 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-yellow-300 mb-2">Character Card: Anne "The Shadowed Ink"</h4>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Role:** Longtime Friend of Kailey's, Tattoo Apprentice</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Personality:** Quiet, observant, but fiercely protective of her professional reputation. She prefers to keep a low profile but can be surprisingly passionate when provoked.</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Connection to Victim (Tatiana Vale):** Anne is well aware of Tatiana's investigative nature and fears she might uncover details about Anne's previous apprenticeships at other, less reputable shops, potentially impacting her current standing at Payne Ink.</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Connection to Others:** She has a strained relationship with **Nate "The Steady Hand"**, stemming from a disagreement at a previous studio they both worked at, which involved a controversial design submission.</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300">**Secret/Motive Hint:** What truly happened at Anne's previous shop that she's so desperate to keep hidden, and was she worried Tatiana would pick up on the scent through her investigations into local artists?</p>

                    <h4 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-yellow-300 mb-2">Character Card: Lilly "The Phoenix Plagiarist"</h4>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Role:** Young Apprentice at Payne Ink, Aspiring Designer</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Personality:** Eager to please, talented, but easily overwhelmed by pressure and desperate for recognition. She once idolized Tatiana Vale and wants nothing more than to be a successful artist.</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Connection to Victim (Tatiana Vale):** Tatiana had discovered Lilly submitted a stolen design in a *previous* contest and was planning to expose her during the party. This would have irrevocably ruined Lilly's career.</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Connection to Others:** She's acutely aware of the heightened scrutiny on originality in the contest, partly due to the recent public feuds initiated by **Miranda "The Vlogging Victim"** over design ownership, which added immensely to Lilly's stress.</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300">**Secret/Motive Hint:** She was desperate to avoid exposure and saw Tatiana as a direct, immediate threat to her entire future in the tattoo world. Her panic led to a tragic, unintended outcome.</p>

                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Role:** Party Guest, Aspiring Craft Influencer</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Personality:** Enthusiastic about her unique craft-art, particularly crochet, but also a bit self-conscious and sensitive to criticism. She dreams of gaining wider recognition for her blend of traditional crafts and modern art.</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Connection to Victim (Tatiana Vale):** Aaliyah follows Tatiana's work closely, hoping for a chance to gain exposure for her unique craft-art on the Inkspire Network. She views Tatiana as a gatekeeper to success but also fears her sharp critiques.</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Connection to Others:** She's quietly resentful of **Kailey "The Birthday Artist's"** instant popularity and "flashy" style, feeling her own more nuanced art is overlooked by the mainstream tattoo world.</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300">**Secret/Motive Hint:** Was Aaliyah seeking to manipulate Tatiana's opinion for her own gain, or did a fear of negative judgment lead her to a desperate act?</p>

                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Personality:** Curious, resourceful, often seen tinkering with gadgets and interested in digital secrets. Has a reputation for being a bit nosy when it comes to technology and online data.</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Connection to Victim (Tatiana Vale):** Lucas is fascinated by internet culture and celebrity, particularly the mechanics of online influence. He sees Tatiana as a master of online information control and wants to understand her methods, perhaps even hoping to learn some "hacks" for his own digital projects.</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Connection to Others:** He was found attempting to access a suspicious device near the crime scene, which he believed might contain vital digital information about *anyone* at the party. He later identifies it as **Miranda "The Vlogging Victim's"** phone.</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300">**Secret/Motive Hint:** What forbidden information was Lucas trying to find on the device, and why was it so urgent that he risked being caught near a murder scene? Was it for personal gain, or did it relate to a larger secret affecting someone specific?</p>

                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Connection to Others:** He had been pressuring **Zak "The Shop Heartthrob"** for weeks to "clean up any loose ends" and ensure the party went off without a hitch, fearing any hint of scandal could damage his substantial investment in Payne Ink.</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300">**Secret/Motive Hint:** How far would James go to protect his investments and the shop's pristine public image from potential scandal initiated by Tatiana, especially if it involved individuals closely tied to the business?</p>

                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Personality:** Stoic, by-the-book, and prides himself on his observational skills. However, he can sometimes be a little too detached, focusing on procedures over people and missing subtle human elements.</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Connection to Victim (Tatiana Vale):** His primary job was to ensure Tatiana's safety and the smooth running of the event. Her death directly reflects poorly on his professionalism and vigilance, and he fears repercussions.</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Connection to Others:** He had a minor but noticeable disagreement with **Melissa "The Rhythmic Regulator"** earlier, as the loud music from the DJ booth made it difficult for him to monitor the entrance to the ink room effectively.</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300">**Secret/Motive Hint:** Was Carter truly oblivious to the murder, or is he deliberately hiding something about what he saw (or didn't see) that night to protect his reputation, or even to cover for someone else's oversight?</p>

                    <h4 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-yellow-300 mb-2">Character Card: Donovan "The Eyewitness"</h4>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Role:** Party Guest, Observant Bystander</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Personality:** A bit socially awkward, but highly observant. He tends to notice small, peculiar details that others often miss. He's earnest but might be easily intimidated or hesitant to share everything he knows.</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Connection to Victim (Tatiana Vale):** Donovan admires Tatiana's work ethic and journalistic integrity, secretly hoping to catch a glimpse of her "investigative process" firsthand.</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Connection to Others:** He claims he saw someone sneak into the ink room with gloves on, and explicitly states it was "definitely not Zak or Kailey," which raised **Carter's "The Silent Security"** eyebrows, as Carter himself didn't report seeing anyone suspicious.
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300">**Secret/Motive Hint:** Who did Donovan see enter the ink room, and why is he being so specific about who it *wasn't*? Is he afraid to name the real person, or does he genuinely only remember fragmented details, perhaps trying to protect someone indirectly?</p>

                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Role:** Local Influencer, Design Contest Finalist (Not the murder victim)</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Personality:** Controversial, attention-seeking, and often confrontational. She believes in leveraging information and creating drama for views, frequently accusing others of perceived slights or unoriginality.</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Connection to Victim (Tatiana Vale):** Miranda respected Tatiana as a fellow media personality and sought to impress her. However, she also saw Tatiana as a potential rival for influence and a potential target for a "shocking expose" of her own.</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Connection to Others:** She was known for public feuds and threats, recently hinting in a vlog at having "leverage" that could "end a career" for "someone here tonight" and ominously stated, "They’ll wish they hadn’t crossed me." This has put **Zak**, **Anne**, and **Kailey** on edge, among others.</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300">**Secret/Motive Hint:** Who was Miranda planning to expose with her "leverage," and did her constant stirring of drama put her in danger, even though she wasn't the target of the poisoning? Her information might have put others at risk, and her recent online activity is highly suspicious.</p>

                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Connection to Victim (Tatiana Vale):** Dante had a very public run-in with Tatiana Vale. She had recently posted a scathing review of a tattoo he received from another artist she deemed "subpar," criticizing not just the artist but implicitly his taste and judgment as a collector.</p>

                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300">**Secret/Motive Hint:** Did Dante seek revenge for the public humiliation and damage to his "collector" reputation by silencing Tatiana, believing she had overstepped her bounds?</p>

                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Role:** Part-Time Tattoo Artist at Payne Ink, Piercing Artist</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Personality:** Calm, meticulous, and generally well-regarded for his steady work. He respects artistic integrity but believes public criticism should have boundaries, especially when it borders on bullying.</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-1">**Connection to Victim (Tatiana Vale):** Nate admired Tatiana's influence but strongly disagreed with her "ruthless" expose methods, particularly when they harmed aspiring or lesser-known artists.

Melissa had recently discovered a significant, unexplained discrepancy in the **solvent cleaner** inventory – a large amount is missing – and she was terrified Tatiana would uncover this irregularity, making her look incompetent or worse. Her role as DJ meant she had access to the ink room for a moment during a track change and could have slipped in undetected.</p>

                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300">**Secret/Motive Hint:** Was Melissa desperate to prevent Tatiana from exposing the missing solvent, which could have been linked to illicit activities or simply made her look grossly negligent? Her access and the timing of the murder are highly suspicious.</p>
